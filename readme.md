Hello!

Welcome to Code for Pittsburgh's Meta Repository.

This is where we host our planning notes, documentation, governance records, and other such documents *about Code for Pittsburgh itself*.

## How to Use This Repo

* Open tasks which need to be completed are represented using the Issue Tracker. We'll document that process as we build it out, and link to that documentation here.
* Agendas, meeting notes, and other governance documents will live in the Governance Folder
* Planning for upcoming events will be collaborated on in the Planning folder
* Documentation of group activities, meeting structures, and other  reusable, sharable planning & curricula will be housed in the Documentation folder.
* Other documents will go in the Other folder

This is a living repository. If you see something that is incomplete or out of date, please, fix it and submit a pull request, or start an issue for it.
